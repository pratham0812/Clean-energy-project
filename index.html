                <div class="content">
                    <p>Clean and affordable energy is a major sustainable development goal set by the UN. It aims to promote energy production methods that do not harm the environment. Currently, 80% of our energy needs are met by traditional means such as fossil fuels. Since clean energy is still not affordable for everyone and cannot yet meet all our energy demands, significant investments are being made in clean energy to ensure future energy security.
                        Renewable energy solutions are becoming cheaper, more reliable, and more efficient every day. Our reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable and harmful to the planet, necessitating a change in how we produce and consume energy. Rapid implementation of these new energy solutions is crucial to counter climate change, one of the biggest threats to our survival</p>

                        <p>Affordable energy is a critical issue that needs to be tackled to ensure a quality life for all. Access to affordable energy is essential for economic development, education, healthcare, and overall well-being. However, many regions still face significant challenges in providing affordable energy to their populations. The slow pace of progress towards universal access to electricity (SDG indicator 7.1.1) reflects the ongoing struggle. Despite advancements, the share of the global population with access to electricity only increased from 78 percent in 2000 to 91 percent in 2021. Projections indicate a marginal rise to 92 percent by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for accelerated efforts.</p>

                        <p>South Asia has made remarkable progress, with electricity access increasing from 58 percent in 2000 to 99 percent in 2021. However, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag, with access rising from 26 percent to 51 percent during the same period. In 2021, half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa still lacked electricity, and access would need to more than double by 2030 to meet SDG target 7.1. The urban-rural gap exacerbates the issue, with rural areas containing 80 percent of the world's population without electricity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the disparity is stark: 30 percent of rural residents had electricity in 2021 compared to 81 percent in urban areas. Addressing this gap is crucial for achieving equitable energy access and improving the quality of life for all, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries.</p>

                <h2>Clean Energy</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Clean energy refers to energy generated from renewable, zero-emission sources that do not release pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. The deployment of clean energy technologies is essential for mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution, and enhancing energy security. Unlike fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants upon combustion, clean energy sources produce minimal to no emissions, rendering them a sustainable solution for the future. Technologies such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, and hydropower plants harness natural processes to generate electricity, offering an environmentally benign alternative to conventional energy sources.</p>
                    <p>The transition to clean energy is imperative for diminishing global reliance on fossil fuels, which currently dominate the energy sector. As of the latest data, clean <i style="font-weight: bolder;color: rgb(34, 152, 52);">energy sources account for approximately 29% of the global electricity</i> supply, with hydropower being the predominant contributor, followed by wind and solar power. This proportion is progressively increasing as nations invest in renewable energy infrastructure and technological advancements render these sources more cost-effective. The shift to clean energy not only aids in combating climate change but also fosters sustainable economic growth, generates employment opportunities, and enhances public health by reducing pollution-related ailments.</p>
